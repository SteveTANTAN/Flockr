"""
The User Data Structure
NOT SURE 

The Spec says to store it like this:
users = [
    user: {
        'u_id': 
        'email': ''
        'name_first':'',
        'name_last':'',
        'handle_str': ''
    }
]

Issue is:
1. How to validate tokens? Are tokens stored in auth.py?
2. How to find each user in the list? Is u_id just used as a list address?
